= Simple repository for all my dotfiles

I currently have a vim dotfile repos, which is annoying me 'cause I want all of my dotfiles on github and not just my
vimdotfiles. In addition to that I like my auto-updating script for vim plugins, I'd like to do that for other dotfiled stuff as well

== TODO

* Create a makefile to install all dotfiles in the correct place
* Add dotfiles: vim, git, bash atm.
